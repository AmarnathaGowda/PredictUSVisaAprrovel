# Revolutionizing US Visa Approvals with AI

The United States embassy gets a large number of visa applications, many of which do not match the acceptance standards and are thus rejected. To improve the speed of the visa application process and provide applicants with preliminary insights, our technology attempts to forecast the possibility of visa approval based on the candidate's submitted information. This prediction model acts as a significant tool in helping applicants through the visa process, perhaps raising the odds of acceptance by allowing them to address any potential concerns in advance.

## System Overview:

Our project aims to predict the outcome of US visa applications by developing a sophisticated machine learning model. This model processes a series of input data to determine the likelihood of visa approval. We source our data from a comprehensive dataset available on Kaggle, which can be found at the following link: [EasyVisa Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moro23/easyvisa-dataset).

To refine our data and enhance the model's accuracy, we undertake Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering. These critical steps are documented in our project notebooks, accessible via the following links:

* EDA Process: [EDA Notebook](https://github.com/AmarnathaGowda/PredictUSVisaAprrovel/blob/main/notebook/1_EDA_US_visa.ipynb)
* Feature Engineering and Model Training: [Feature Engineering Notebook](https://github.com/AmarnathaGowda/PredictUSVisaAprrovel/blob/main/notebook/2_Feature_Engineering_and_Model_Training.ipynb)

Our approach is not limited to a single machine learning algorithm; instead, we explore a variety of classification algorithms including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, K-Neighbors Classifier, XGBClassifier, and CatBoost Classifier. To optimize performance, we apply hyperparameter tuning to these models and select the most effective one based on predictive accuracy.

The project is structured in a modular code format, facilitating maintainability and scalability. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are implemented via GitHub Actions, ensuring automated testing and deployment. The final system is hosted on AWS, leveraging services such as S3 buckets, Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and EC2 instances to provide a robust and scalable solution.

## Tech stack: 

Our project harnesses a diverse and powerful set of technologies to create a robust and efficient system for predicting US visa approval outcomes 🚀. Here's a breakdown of our tech stack:

* **Python 🐍:** Our core programming language, chosen for its versatility and the vast ecosystem of data science libraries. 
    We adhere to a modular coding approach for better maintainability and readability.
* **Jupyter Notebook 📓:** Utilized for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering, allowing us 
    to iteratively explore and visualize our data with ease.
* **VS Code 🛠️:** Our Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of choice, providing a powerful platform for code development 
    with extensive support for Python and data science workflows.
* **MongoDB 🍃:** This NoSQL document database stores and manages our visa application data. Its flexible schema and scalability 
    make it ideal for handling our large and complex datasets.
* **GitHub 🐱:** Serves as our version control system and the backbone for our Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment 
    (CI/CD) workflows, ensuring our project remains collaborative and up-to-date.
* **FastAPI 🚀:** Chosen for its speed and ease of use, FastAPI helps us build our application's wireframe, enabling quick 
    and reliable interaction with our predictive model.
* **AWS ☁️:** Amazon Web Services provide the infrastructure for deploying our application/model. From compute power (EC2) to 
    storage (S3) and container management (ECR), AWS ensures our system is scalable, secure, and accessible.

Each component of our tech stack plays a crucial role in delivering a seamless and effective solution for predicting the outcome of US visa applications.
